//! # `CyanSWF`
//! `CyanSWF` short for Cyan "StreamingWriteFile" is a minimal implementation
//! of a file to which writes are _streamed_.
//!
//! What this essentially means â€” is that,
//! instead of taking a whole object and then writing it to the disk, like what persistent
//! storage did till v0.4.2, `CyanSWF` takes a part, encodes into its _kinda binary_
//! equivalent, and then writes that to disk. It then takes the next part, encodes it, and then writes it to disk.
//! The advantage of using this method is that the entire object does not need to be encoded at once
//! which has an additional memory and CPU time overhead.
//!
//! TODO: At this moment, this is specific to the core `HashMap`. However, in the future
//! a more generic implementation is to be made.

use crate::diskstore::TResult;
use std::fs::File;

/// The magic number that separates every piece of data from the other
const CYANSWF_MAGIC: u8 = 0xCA;

/// The streaming file writer
pub struct CyanSWF {
    /// The file to which data would be streamed into
    file: File,
}

impl CyanSWF {
    /// Create a new `CyanSWF` instance
    pub fn new(filename_and_path: &str) -> TResult<Self> {
        let file = File::create(filename_and_path)?;
        Ok(CyanSWF { file })
    }
}
